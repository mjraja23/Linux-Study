Explanation:
The script first checks if exactly one argument is provided.
It verifies that the input is a valid integer (supports negative numbers).
It uses the rev command to reverse the digits.
For negative numbers, it handles the negative sign separately by stripping it from the reversed string and reappending it at the front.
