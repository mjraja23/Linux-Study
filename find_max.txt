Explanation:
The script checks if at least one argument is provided.
It initializes max with the first argument.
It loops through each provided argument to check if it's an integer using a regular expression.
The script then compares each number with the current maximum and updates the max variable if the current number is larger.
Finally, it prints the largest number found.
